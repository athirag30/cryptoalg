# Classical Cipher Implementations in C

This repository contains C implementations of 13 classical encryption algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.c` file with a simple `main()` function for demonstration.

## 🔐 Implemented Ciphers

1. **Caesar Cipher**
2. **Atbash Cipher**
3. **August Cipher**
